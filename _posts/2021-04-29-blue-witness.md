title: The Blue Witness Project
subtitle: My contributions to the Human Rights First Blue Witness application
---

This project was a collaboration between Lambda School and Human Rights First, a nonprofit organization that challenges America to live up to her ideals.
Inapropirate use of police force has been a problem for some time, so I helped build a tool to keep track of incidents around the country to keep police 
forces honest. Going into this project I was afraid it might become political, yet Human Rights First has done a great job of keeping policits out of their goals.

#### Technical Contributions
To obtain information for this project we scraped Twitter for keywords related to police activity, and presented those tweets to an admin to approve to be put on the map. Often times these tweets describe real incidents, yet they don't include enough information to be usable. I was tasked with writing a Twitter bot that could reply to these sources to ask for more information. It then updates the information with the response to be approved by the admin again.

The main technical challenge for this task was code compatibility. The front and backend is written in Javascript, and I work in Python, so implimenting my rough bot could prove to be difficult. Luckily, I know a little Javascript, enough that I was able to rewrite it in Javascript. While it did take some time, it made implimentation a simple function call.
