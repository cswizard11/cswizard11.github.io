title: The Blue Witness Project
subtitle: My contributions to the Human Rights First Blue Witness application
---

This project was a collaboration between Lambda School and Human Rights First, a nonprofit organization that challenges America to live up to her ideals.
Inapropirate use of police force has been a problem for some time, so I helped build a tool to keep track of incidents around the country to keep police 
forces honest. Going into this project I was afraid it might become political, yet Human Rights First has done a great job of keeping policits out of their goals.
