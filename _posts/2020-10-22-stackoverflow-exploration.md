##### For my project, I found this great little data set from Stackoverflow. It's a data dump of 250,000 answers to questions, with 11 different variables about those answers. One of those is the number of upvotes the answer got. Looking at that, I came up with an intriguing and useful research question.



# Research question:
### Is there a relationship between any of these vairables and the answer score? If so, what can I change about my question to increase my chances of getting a better answer?

Looking at the variables availible, the one that stands out to me the most is the score of the question. It would make sense that a question with a lot of upvotes would get an answer with a lot of upvotes. But does the data agree that there is a relationship between the two? Here's a graph to answer that question.
