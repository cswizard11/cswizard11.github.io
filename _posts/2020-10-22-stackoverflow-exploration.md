##### For my project, I found this great little data set from Stackoverflow. It's a data dump of 250,000 answers to questions, with 11 different variables about those answers. One of those is the number of upvotes the answer got. Looking at that, I came up with an intriguing and useful research question.

# Research question:
### Is there a relationship between any of these vairables and the answer score? If so, what can I change about my question to increase my chances of getting a better answer?
